## ðŸ”§ Day-5: API Testing, CSS Selectors, and Web Automation
Day-5 of the Skill Lab was packed with learning about APIs and web automation toolsâ€”critical skills for modern web development. The session started with an introduction to REST architecture, where we explored how APIs facilitate communication between client and server. We had hands-on activities that helped us make API calls in local development environments and then tested deployed APIs, which included managing authentication headers and configuring request parameters. This gave us a valuable opportunity to practice debugging and validating API responses, which are essential skills for ensuring smooth communication between front-end and back-end services.

The latter part of the session shifted focus to CSS selectors and Selenium for automating web tasks. We learned how to effectively select DOM elements using CSS selectors, a key skill for both styling and scripting in web development. We also dived into Selenium, writing basic automation scripts to simulate user actions and interact with web pages. These activities provided hands-on experience in UI testing, element interaction, and automating web workflows, which are all essential for quality assurance and front-end development.

By the end of the day, we had gained practical experience in API testing, request debugging, and web automation, equipping us with skills that are highly valued in both QA and full-stack development.
