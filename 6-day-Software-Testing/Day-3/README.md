## ðŸŽ¯ Day-3: Portfolio Building & Placement Readiness
Day-3 of the Skill Lab was all about preparing students for the real world by focusing on personal branding and placement readiness. The session emphasized that creating a professional portfolio website is not just a project â€” itâ€™s a powerful tool for building a digital presence that can have a significant impact on career prospects.

We were given a comprehensive guide on what key elements to include in our portfolios, such as showcasing technical skills, detailing past projects, listing certifications, and highlighting any achievements. This made us realize that a well-rounded portfolio is essential in effectively presenting ourselves to potential employers.

Mentors also reminded us of the increasing competitiveness in todayâ€™s job market. They stressed the importance of taking placements seriously and starting preparations early. The discussion helped us understand that a well-crafted portfolio can not only help us stand out to recruiters but can also enhance our chances in the hiring process.

By the end of the day, it was clear that portfolio development is closely linked to career readiness. We left the session feeling motivated to put time into showcasing our skills, documenting our learning experiences, and approaching our future opportunities with professionalism.
