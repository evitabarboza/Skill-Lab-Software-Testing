## üåê Day-4: Web Deployment & Git Essentials
Day-4 of the Skill Lab was all about diving into the real-world tools and practices needed for web deployment and version control. The session kicked off with a hands-on exercise where we deployed our portfolio websites and successfully hosted them on Render, a cloud platform for web services. This gave us a detailed understanding of the deployment process ‚Äî from taking a local web project to making it accessible on the internet. Seeing our work go live was incredibly rewarding!

In addition to deployment, we spent time learning about Git, one of the most essential tools in modern development. We were introduced to core Git concepts like how to clone repositories so we could work on local versions of remote projects, and how to fork repositories ‚Äî a key skill for contributing to open-source projects or collaborating with others. We also practiced pushing code changes to remote repositories, which is crucial for keeping our work up to date and in sync with collaborators.

By the end of the session, we had gained hands-on experience with Git and deployment, leaving us with a strong foundation in both version control and web hosting. The knowledge and skills acquired today will be incredibly valuable in future projects and in real-world development environments.
